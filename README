Project will take a directory of stuff (from talon?) and turn it into
a video, which can be easily played on the display box using a video
player on fullscreen and repeat.

== USE ==

buildshow.rb path/to/dir output.mpg config.txt

Dir with all files in the form:
###.MODE.filename.ext

.scroll .kenburns .video .text (same # & name /or with .txt, applies on image, and otherwise would be an additional "slide")

== INSTALL ==

This requires image2mpeg, downloaded from here:
http://www.gromeck.de/uploads/media/image2mpeg-1.02.tar.gz

Note: image2mpeg has a common functions shell file which needs nicerun
to be modified to return 0 on success, or else error detection doesn't
work (it always returns 1). Also may need some PATH settings initially.

That requires libmagick++-dev to be built (using: ./configure && make).
